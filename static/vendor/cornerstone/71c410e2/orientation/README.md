# `Human.vtp` — the 3D orientation marker

The human figure shown in the corner of the volume render, the same one 3D Slicer
uses. It is **Cornerstone's own choice of asset**, not ours:
`OrientationMarkerTool`'s `CUSTOM` overlay type defaults to exactly this file
(`@cornerstonejs/tools/dist/esm/tools/OrientationMarkerTool.js`, `polyDataURL`).

It is vendored here rather than fetched from that default URL, and **not** because of
any rule against third-party hosts — there is none; see `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The reason is
the URL itself: `raw.githubusercontent.com` is a source-browsing endpoint, not an asset
host, and it serves whatever the branch says today. Copying the file in pins it and lets
the entry resolve it through `import.meta.url` like the web workers. Same treatment
finding F5 gave itk-wasm's jsdelivr default, for the same reason: keep the upstream
feature, drop the moving reference.

Pinned to that commit deliberately: the file is geometry, it does not need updating,
and a moving reference would change what clinicians see with no diff to review.
