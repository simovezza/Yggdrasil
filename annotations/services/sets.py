"""Writing annotation work. The only layer permitted to save.

A view that imports a model and calls ``.save()`` is a review failure, and the
reason is here: every write has to allocate a revision number, refresh the
monotonic ``ever_annotated`` flag, fingerprint the targets and validate the
items, all in one transaction. Spread that across three views and one of them
will forget the flag, and the raw-data lock will let somebody replace a scan
that has landmarks on it.

The concurrency contract is worth reading before using :func:`record_revision`.
A caller that loaded revision 7 passes ``expected_revision=7``; the write
inserts revision 8, and if another writer got there first the unique constraint
refuses and the caller gets :class:`AnnotationConflict`. There is no
read-then-write window, because the check *is* the write -- no ``SELECT
MAX(...)`` to lose a race against. Passing ``expected_revision=None`` opts out
and appends after whatever is there; that is for migrations and imports, which
have no concurrent editor to lose to.
