"""The measurement-saving endpoint.

Domain-oriented, per the governing architectural rule: the URL names a patient and the
work being done, and the body is a list of annotations. There is no
``POST /cornerstone/save`` and there is not going to be -- what arrives is translated
into descriptors before anything is written, every number is recomputed from the
geometry, and the viewer's own serialized state is stored as a non-canonical scratch
payload. Replacing Cornerstone would kill the payload and leave the record intact.

Thin, deliberately. It authorises, parses, and hands off to
:func:`annotations.services.viewer.save_measurements`, which is the only thing here
that writes. A view that imported a model and called ``.save()`` would be a review
failure (CONTRIBUTING), and the reason is concrete: every write has to allocate a
revision number against the unique constraint, refresh ``ever_annotated`` and
fingerprint the targets in one transaction, and a caller free to skip a step will
eventually skip the flag.

This lives in ``annotations/`` rather than in a domain app because it serves all three
namespaces and ``AnnotationSet`` already carries all three patient FKs.
``maxillo.views.domain.get_domain_models`` only knows maxillo and laparoscopy, so the
resolution is done here instead of bending that helper.
