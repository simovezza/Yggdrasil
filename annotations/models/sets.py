"""The spine: a set of annotation work, what it points at, and its revisions.

Reading order is ``AnnotationSet`` -> ``AnnotationTarget`` (+ its
``AnnotationSelector`` rows) -> ``AnnotationRevision`` -> ``AnnotationPayload``.
A set says *whose work this is and what kind*; targets say *what content it is
anchored to*; a revision is one saved state of that work; payloads are the
encodings of that state, exactly one of which is canonical.

Two invariants here are enforced by the database rather than by code, because
both fail in ways that are hard to see:

* ``UniqueConstraint(annotation_set, revision_number)`` **is** the
  optimistic-concurrency primitive. Two browsers that both loaded revision 7 and
  both save will both try to insert revision 8; one wins and the other gets an
  ``IntegrityError``, which the service turns into a 409. There is no read-then-
  write window to lose, because the check *is* the write.
* "Exactly one primary target" and "exactly one canonical payload" are nullable
  slot columns, not conditional constraints. Django compiles
  ``UniqueConstraint(condition=...)`` to nothing on MySQL -- no partial index and
  no error (F12) -- so the rule would be enforced in tests on SQLite and absent
  in production. A ``primary_slot`` that is ``1`` on the primary row and ``NULL``
  everywhere else gets the same guarantee out of plain ``UNIQUE``, because MySQL
  treats NULLs as distinct.
