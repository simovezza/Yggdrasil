"""Declarative catalog of exportable artifacts and export filters.

Before this module the same modality -> file_type mapping existed three times
(``maxillo.views.export.EXPORT_MODALITY_FILE_TYPES``,
``ExportProcessor.MODALITY_TO_FILE_TYPES`` and
``brain.export_config.BRAIN_EXPORT_MODALITY_FILE_TYPES``) and had already drifted
apart, while the export form offered a fixed four-checkbox "content type" that
could not name the things people actually want (the CBCT segmentation on its own,
the panoramic MIP but not the X-ray, IOS landmarks, ...).

An **artifact** is one exportable thing: a group of ``FileRegistry`` rows, one
named output nested inside a row's ``metadata['files']``, or a database-derived
document with no file behind it at all (voice captions, occlusion
classification, tooth segmentation). Every artifact declares the modality that
owns it, so the export form can offer exactly the artifacts a project's own
modalities can produce, and only those that actually exist in the selected
folders.

A **filter** narrows the patient set. Filters are likewise derived from the
project: a project that does not collect IOS landmarks is never offered a
"has landmarks" filter.
