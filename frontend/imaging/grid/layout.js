/**
 * The volume grid's shape: four windows, what each one shows, and what that means to
 * Cornerstone.
 *
 * Pure. No Cornerstone import -- the enum values are inlined as the string literals
 * they are (`@cornerstonejs/core/enums/OrientationAxis.js` and `ViewportType.js`,
 * verified against the shipped 5.8.2) so that this module, and the state machine next
 * to it, can be reasoned about and tested without a GPU. {@link assertEnumsMatch} is
 * how that inlining is kept honest: the entry calls it once with the real enums, and a
 * version bump that renames a value fails loudly at start-up rather than by silently
 * producing a viewport that renders nothing.
 *
 * Two things this module deliberately does not do:
 *
 *   - **It does not persist anything.** `viewportId` and `volumeId` are Cornerstone
 *     runtime identifiers, session-scoped by the governing rule in
 *     docs/cornerstone-roadmap.md, and nothing downstream may treat one as an identity.
 *     They are derived here so they are derived *once*, not so they can be stored.
 *   - **It does not decide what a window shows.** That is `windowState.js`. This module
 *     answers "given that window 2 is showing a coronal slice, what does Cornerstone
 *     need to be told?" and nothing else.

 * rotate the plane, and squares that drag the slab thickness. Both were reported as
 * clutter -- "an additional square and circle on all axis" -- and neither is wanted here:
 * this grid's planes are orthogonal by construction, and its slab thickness is not a
 * control the application exposes anywhere.
 *
 * **This was done by turning `getReferenceLineDraggableRotatable` off, and that switch
 * does not mean what its name suggests.** It gates the *rotation handles*, yes -- and it
 * also gates every **translation** the tool performs. `_jump`, which is what a click on
 * the image runs, filters the other viewports through
 *
 *     this._getReferenceLineControllable(id) && this._getReferenceLineDraggableRotatable(id) && sameScene
 *
 * and returns `false` without moving anything when that leaves an empty list
 * (`CrosshairsTool.js:942-952`). `_dragCallback`'s `OPERATION.DRAG` branch filters on the
 * same flag (`:1029-1035`), and `addNewAnnotation` builds `activeViewportIds` from it
 * too, so the drag had nothing to act on either. The result was a crosshair that drew
 * three clean green lines and could not be moved by clicking or by dragging -- the
 * reported bug, and a strictly worse one than the clutter it was fixing.
 *
 * So the handles are removed by the switch that removes *only* the handles: the tool's
 * `minimal` profile. Under it, and only in the drawing and hit-testing paths,
 * `viewportDraggableRotatable` and `viewportSlabThicknessControlsOn` are forced false
 * (`:533-538`), the slab handle points are never even computed (`:588`), and
 * `_getRotationHandleNearImagePoint` / `_getSlabThicknessHandleNearImagePoint` refuse to
 * match (`:1668`, `:1695`) -- so neither handle can be drawn *or* grabbed invisibly.
 * `_jump` and `_dragCallback` read the raw callbacks, which are left at their default
 * `true`, so click-to-navigate and line dragging work exactly as they always should have.
 * {@link CROSSHAIR_LINE_LENGTH_PX} is what keeps the lines full length under that profile.
 *
 * **`mobile.enabled` is the third switch, and it stays off.** `mobile` defaults to
 * `{enabled: isMobile(), ...}` (`CrosshairsTool.js:80-85`) where `isMobile()` is
 * `matchMedia('(any-pointer:coarse)').matches` (`utilities/touch/index.js:153-157`) --
 * **true on any machine with a touchscreen attached**, which a clinical workstation
 * frequently is. Mobile mode raises `handleRadius` to 9 and draws the handles
 * *permanently* rather than during a drag (`:622-641`), which is how the clutter got
 * reported in the first place. This grid is driven with a mouse.
 *
 * `getReferenceLineControllable` is deliberately left alone -- dragging a line is how the
 * crosshair navigates, and that is the point of having it.
 *
 * @returns {object} configuration for `toolGroup.addTool`.
