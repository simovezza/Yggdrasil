/**
 * Mounting the volume grid on a patient page.
 *
 * `{% cornerstone_entry 'volume-grid' %}` loads the bundle for its side effects, so
 * something has to notice the page and start. This is that something, and it is
 * deliberately the only module in `imaging/grid/` that reads the DOM or the global
 * scope by itself.
 *
 * Two rules it follows, both learned from what it replaces:
 *
 * **It never throws into the page.** `viewer_grid.js` ran on every patient detail page
 * in three namespaces, most of which have no volume at all. A bootstrap that throws on
 * a page without a grid takes the rest of the patient record down with it -- the
 * classification form, the file management section, the export button. So every exit is
 * a return, and a real failure is reported into the grid itself where a user can see
 * it, not only to the console.
 *
 * **It reports the F2 warning.** A volume whose header declares no orientation renders
 * perfectly and may be left-right mirrored. `loadVolumeIntoWindow` hands the warning
 * back rather than logging it; this is what puts it on screen.
