/**
 * Entry point: CBCT + brain volume grid (roadmap Phase 3).
 *
 * **Not yet wired.** `templates/common/patient_detail.html` still loads NiiVue and
 * `viewer_grid.js`; the swap and the deletions are gated on a green validation-harness
 * run across the maxillo *and* brain corpora, which is the roadmap's own condition for
 * this phase. What is here is the replacement, built and testable ahead of that gate.
 *
 * The imports below are also what pull the three web workers and the ICRPolySeg wasm
 * into the emitted tree, so `npm run verify` has something to check.
 *
 * Cornerstone is imported *here* and injected into `createVolumeGrid` rather than
 * imported by `imaging/grid/viewportManager.js` directly. That keeps every module
 * under `imaging/grid/` importable under `node --test`, which is what lets the layout,
 * the window state machine and the VOI conversions carry 30 tests between them while
 * the part that genuinely needs a GPU stays one thin file.
